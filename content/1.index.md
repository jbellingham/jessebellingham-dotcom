<h5 style="text-align: center;">Hi hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jesse.</h5>

<img src="me.jpg" width="300" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

I am a software engineer passionate about building the right thing, and
building it right.

These are some of the things I care about:
- Organisational and team culture (in particular, safety to explore and, on occasion, get things wrong)
- Autonomy of the team and individual
- CI/CD
- Monitoring and observability
- Evolutionary design over upfront design

I am currently looking for work as a full stack or backend engineer - here's <a href="Jesse Bellingham CV.pdf" target="_blank" download="Jesse Bellingham CV.pdf">my CV</a>, let's connect!
